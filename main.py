    ## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

#TODO 1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]
# yesterday_closing_price = data_list[0]['4. close']
# print(yesterday_closing_price)

#TODO 2. - Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price
# day_before_yesterday_closing_price = data_list[1]['4. close']
# print(day_before_yesterday_closing_price)

#TODO 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp
# difference = abs(float(yesterday_closing_price) - float(day_before_yesterday_closing_price))
# print(difference)


#TODO 4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.
# percent_diff = (difference / float(yesterday_closing_price)) * 100
# print(percent_diff)

# #TODO 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").
# if percent_diff > 5:

response2 = requests.get(url="https://newsapi.org/v2/everything",params=news_params)
response2.raise_for_status()
articles = response2.json()['articles']
# print(articles)

#TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

#TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation
three_articles = articles[:3]

    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.

#TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

new_list_articles = [f"Headline: {article['title']}. \n Brief: {article['description']} " for article in three_articles]
print(new_list_articles)
#TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.



#Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
